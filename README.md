- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): For code linting and maintaining code quality.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm is bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nimasaghi-dev/landing-page.git
   cd landing-page
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the landing page.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code issues.
